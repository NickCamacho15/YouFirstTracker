Please check the Supabase dashboard for the database connection settings:

1. Go to the Supabase dashboard
2. Click on your project (YouFirst Tracker)
3. Click on "Project Settings" (gear icon) in the left sidebar
4. Click on "Database" in the left sidebar
5. Look for the "Connection Info" or "Connection Pooling" section
6. Check if there's a "Connection String" that you can copy

Also, since you're on a Pro plan, check if your database might be paused. Free tier databases are paused after 1 week of inactivity, but Pro tier databases should remain active.
