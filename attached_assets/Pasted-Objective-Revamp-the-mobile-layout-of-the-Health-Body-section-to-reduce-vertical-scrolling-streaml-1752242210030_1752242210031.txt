Objective:
Revamp the mobile layout of the Health/Body section to reduce vertical scrolling, streamline access to key features, and enhance clarity — drawing inspiration from WHOOP’s UI while keeping our app’s clean white/light brand style.

🧭 General Design Principles:
Keep our light/white background and card-based structure (brand congruence).

Use Whoop's structure as a guide: segmented blocks, horizontal nav bars, clean data hierarchy.

Prioritize mobile-first responsive design — should be easy to scan at a glance.

🔁 Navigation Layout:
Add a top horizontal tab selector (sticky or fixed) that switches between:

Overview

Progress

Volume

Workout History

Use visual cues to show the active tab (e.g., underline, bold, slightly raised button).

Each tab should lazy-load its content without page reload.

🧩 Redesign Sections for Compactness:
1. Overview Tab
Grid of 2x2 small stat cards (e.g., Completion Rate, Time Spent, Volume Change)

Place "Weekly Progress" and "Muscle Group Focus" in collapsible or swipeable cards

Example: Tap the card to expand into a full-screen modal or slide-up drawer for details

2. Progress + Volume Tabs
Show a single simple line graph (like WHOOP’s), using toggles to switch Week | Month | Year

Place the toggles above the graph

Graph should:

Be responsive and touch-friendly

Have subtle tooltips on hover/tap

Stick to flat colors with simple point markers (no gradients or shading)

3. Workout History Tab
Use card rows (like you already have) with program name + date range + “View” button

Add subtle separators between cards to make scanning easier

📱 Additional Mobile Optimizations:
Use slideable or segmented buttons for Week/Day toggles in the workout builder (to avoid stacking)

Use icon + label combos for navigation (like WHOOP’s bottom nav bar)

Introduce scroll shadows or indicators to hint there’s more off-screen content

Consider collapsing less-used elements (e.g., template descriptions) until tapped

📐 Bonus – Layout Enhancements to Steal from WHOOP:
Use color-coded feedback (e.g., green = improvement, red = decline) for stat deltas

Use card headers with context like: “+15% since last week” in smaller font

Prioritize bold numbers first, then small labels (e.g., 7.5 hrs then Time Spent This Week)

For multi-metric graphs (like strain vs recovery), give each metric a distinct, readable colo
