Please check the Supabase dashboard for the correct database connection information:

1. Go to the Supabase dashboard
2. Click on your project (YouFirst Tracker)
3. Click on "Project Settings" (gear icon) in the left sidebar
4. Click on "Database" in the left sidebar
5. Look for the "Connection Info" section
6. Check the "Host" value - it should match the hostname in your connection string

Also, check if there's a "Connection String" section where you can directly copy the connection string format.

The connection string should be in this format:
postgres://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@[HOST]:[PORT]/postgres

Where:
- [YOUR-PASSWORD] is your database password
- [HOST] is the database hostname (should be db.jevviwdsnyvvtpnqbecm.supabase.co)
- [PORT] is the database port (should be 5432 for direct connection or 6543 for connection pooler)

Additionally, check if there's a "Connection Pooling" section that provides a different hostname for connection pooling.
