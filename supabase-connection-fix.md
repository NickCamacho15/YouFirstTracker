# Supabase Connection Fix Guide

Based on our tests, there are several issues that need to be addressed to fix the connection to your Supabase project:

## 1. Check Project Status

First, verify that your Supabase project is active:

1. Go to the Supabase dashboard
2. Check if your project is paused or has any warnings
3. If it's paused, resume it
4. If you're on a free tier, note that projects are paused after 1 week of inactivity

## 2. Update API Keys

The API keys appear to be outdated or incorrect:

1. Go to Project Settings > API
2. Copy the current anon/public key and service_role key
3. Update your `.env` file with these keys:
   ```
   SUPABASE_URL=https://jevviwdsnyvvtpnqbecm.supabase.co
   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_current_anon_key
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_current_service_role_key
   ```

## 3. Get the Correct Database Connection String

1. Go to Project Settings > Database
2. Look for the "Connection Pooling" section
3. Copy the "Connection string" for the pooler connection
4. Update your `.env` file with this connection string:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=your_pooler_connection_string
   ```

## 4. Modify Server Code for Better Error Handling

Consider implementing the improved error handling and connection retry logic from the `storage-fix.ts` file we created.

## 5. Check Database Access Settings

1. Go to Project Settings > Database
2. Check if there are any IP restrictions or network policies that might be blocking your connection
3. Consider adding your current IP address to the allowed list if necessary

## 6. Restart Your Project

If you've made all these changes and are still having issues:

1. Go to Project Settings > General
2. Find the "Restart Project" button
3. Confirm and restart your project

This will reset all connections and might resolve any temporary issues.

## 7. Check Database Schema

The 40 security issues you're seeing are related to Row Level Security (RLS) not being enabled on several tables. While this is a security concern, it shouldn't prevent the database connection from working.

## 8. Last Resort: Create a New Project

If none of the above steps work, you might need to create a new Supabase project and migrate your data and schema to it.

## Testing Your Connection

After making these changes, test your connection with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

If you're still having issues, please provide the specific error messages for further troubleshooting.
